## How Ranking Works

Synera's ranking system is designed to be both powerful and safe, providing fine-grained control over who can rank whom, while preventing accidental demotions or unauthorized promotions.

## Rank Structure

Every Roblox group has a hierarchical rank structure that Synera respects and enhances:

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-purple-50 dark:from-blue-900/20 dark:to-purple-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">Example Group Hierarchy</h3>
  <div className="space-y-2">
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between p-2 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded">
      <span className="font-medium">Owner</span>
      <span className="text-sm text-gray-500">Rank 255</span>
    </div>
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between p-2 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded">
      <span className="font-medium">Co-Owner</span>
      <span className="text-sm text-gray-500">Rank 200</span>
    </div>
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between p-2 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded">
      <span className="font-medium">Administrator</span>
      <span className="text-sm text-gray-500">Rank 150</span>
    </div>
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between p-2 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded">
      <span className="font-medium">Moderator</span>
      <span className="text-sm text-gray-500">Rank 100</span>
    </div>
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between p-2 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded">
      <span className="font-medium">Member</span>
      <span className="text-sm text-gray-500">Rank 50</span>
    </div>
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between p-2 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded">
      <span className="font-medium">Guest</span>
      <span className="text-sm text-gray-500">Rank 1</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Ranking Commands

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Permission System

Synera implements a multi-layered permission system to ensure ranking security:

### 1. Discord Role Permissions

Configure which Discord roles can use ranking commands:

<CodeGroup>
```json Basic Setup
{
  "ranking_permissions": {
    "Administrator": ["rank", "promote", "demote", "massrank"],
    "Moderator": ["promote", "demote"],
    "Helper": ["promote"]
  }
}
```

```json Advanced Setup
{
  "ranking_permissions": {
    "Owner": ["*"],
    "Co-Owner": ["rank", "promote", "demote", "massrank", "ranklock"],
    "Administrator": {
      "commands": ["rank", "promote", "demote"],
      "max_rank": "Moderator",
      "restrictions": ["cannot_rank_admins"]
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Rank-Based Restrictions

Users cannot rank members to positions higher than their own:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hierarchy Protection" icon="shield">
    - Moderators cannot promote members to Administrator
    - Members cannot demote Administrators
    - Automatic validation prevents hierarchy violations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Self-Ranking Prevention" icon="user-slash">
    - Users cannot rank themselves
    - Prevents accidental self-demotion
    - Maintains accountability in ranking actions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Protected Ranks" icon="lock">
    - Certain ranks can be marked as protected
    - Only specific roles can modify protected ranks
    - Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive positions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Custom Restrictions

Set up custom rules for your community:

```yaml
restrictions:
  - name: "Trial Period"
    condition: "member_age < 30_days"
    action: "prevent_promotion"
    message: "Members must be in the group for 30 days before promotion"
  
  - name: "Activity Requirement"
    condition: "last_seen > 7_days"
    action: "require_confirmation"
    message: "Member has been inactive for over a week"
  
  - name: "Rank Cooldown"
    condition: "last_ranked < 24_hours"
    action: "prevent_ranking"
    message: "Member was ranked recently, please wait 24 hours"
```

## Ranking Workflows

### Standard Ranking Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Command Execution">
    User executes a ranking command with target member and desired rank
  </Step>
  <Step title="Permission Validation">
    Synera checks if the user has permission to execute the command
  </Step>
  <Step title="Target Validation">
    Verifies the target member exists and is in the group
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hierarchy Check">
    Ensures the ranking action respects group hierarchy rules
  </Step>
  <Step title="Roblox API Call">
    Executes the ranking change via Roblox's group API
  </Step>
  <Step title="Discord Role Update">
    Updates the member's Discord roles to match their new rank
  </Step>
  <Step title="Audit Logging">
    Records the action in audit logs with timestamp and reason
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    Sends confirmation message with details of the ranking change
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Bulk Ranking Process

For mass ranking operations, Synera uses an optimized workflow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Mass Rank Command] --> B[Validate All Targets]
    B --> C[Check Rate Limits]
    C --> D[Create Ranking Queue]
    D --> E[Process Queue with Delays]
    E --> F[Update Discord Roles]
    F --> G[Generate Report]
    G --> H[Send Summary]
```

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Audit & Logging

Every ranking action is thoroughly logged:

### Audit Log Format

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "action": "rank",
  "executor": {
    "discord_id": "123456789012345678",
    "username": "AdminUser",
    "roblox_id": "987654321"
  },

```

### Log Retention
