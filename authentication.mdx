## Overview

Synera uses secure authentication methods to connect your Discord server with your Roblox group. This ensures that only authorized users can manage rankings and access sensitive group information.

## Discord Authentication

Synera automatically handles Discord authentication through OAuth2 when you invite the bot to your server.

## API Authentication

For developers integrating with Synera's API, authentication is handled through API keys.

### Getting an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Dashboard">
    Visit the [Synera Dashboard](https://dashboard.synera.cc) and log in
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to API">
    Go to the API section in your server settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Key">
    Click "Generate New API Key" and copy the generated key
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Permissions">
    Set the appropriate permissions for your API key
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using API Keys

Include your API key in the Authorization header of your requests:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.synera.cc/v1/groups/123456" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

<Note>
  API keys should be kept secure and never exposed in client-side code. Store them as environment variables or in secure configuration files.
</Note>
