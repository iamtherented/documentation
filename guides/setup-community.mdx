</Note>

## Step 2: Initial Configuration

Once Synera is in your server, you'll need to run the initial setup:

### Run the Setup Command

```bash
/setup_community
```

This command will guide you through the configuration process with an interactive setup wizard.

### Setup Wizard Flow

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic Information">
    **Group ID Input**
    ```bash
    /setup_community group_id:12345678
    ```
    
    **How to find your Group ID:**
    1. Go to your Roblox group page
    2. Look at the URL: `https://www.roblox.com/groups/12345678/Group-Name`
    3. The number after `/groups/` is your Group ID
    
    **Group Verification**
    - Synera will verify the group exists
    - Check if you have sufficient permissions
    - Display group information for confirmation
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Authentication">
    **Choose Authentication Method**
    
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Cookie Authentication (Recommended)" icon="cookie">
        Most reliable method for all group operations.
        
        **Steps:**
        1. Log into Roblox in your browser
        2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
        3. Navigate to Application → Cookies → roblox.com
        4. Find `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie
        5. Copy the entire value
        6. Paste it securely in the setup (DM with bot)
      </Accordion>
      
      <Accordion title="API Key Authentication" icon="key">
        For users with Roblox Premium and API access.
        
        **Requirements:**
        - Roblox Premium subscription
        - API access enabled
        - Valid API key generated
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Role Mapping">
    **Automatic Role Creation**
    
    Synera will offer to create Discord roles that match your Roblox ranks:
    
    ```
    ✅ Create role "Group Owner" for rank "Owner" (255)
    ✅ Create role "Co-Owner" for rank "Co-Owner" (200)  
    ✅ Create role "Administrator" for rank "Administrator" (150)
    ✅ Create role "Moderator" for rank "Moderator" (100)
    ✅ Create role "Member" for rank "Member" (50)
    ```
    
    **Manual Role Mapping**
    
    If you prefer to use existing roles:
    ```bash
    /config role_mapping rank:100 discord_role:@Moderator
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Permission Configuration

Set up who can use Synera's commands in your server:

### Basic Permission Setup

```bash
# Allow Admins to use all ranking commands
/config permissions role:@Admin commands:all

# Allow Moderators to promote/demote only
/config permissions role:@Moderator commands:promote,demote

# Allow Members to view information only
/config permissions role:@Member commands:memberinfo,groupinfo
```

### Advanced Permission Configuration

<CodeGroup>
```json Basic Setup
{
  "permissions": {
    "Admin": {
      "commands": ["*"],
      "restrictions": []
    },
    "Moderator": {
      "commands": ["promote", "demote", "memberinfo"],
      "max_rank": "Member",
      "restrictions": ["cannot_rank_staff"]
    }
  }
}
```

```json Advanced Setup
{
  "permissions": {
    "Owner": {
      "commands": ["*"],
      "restrictions": [],
      "bypass_cooldowns": true
    },
    "Admin": {
      "commands": ["rank", "promote", "demote", "massrank"],
      "max_rank": "Moderator", 
      "restrictions": ["require_reason"],
      "cooldown": "30s"
    },
    "Moderator": {
      "commands": ["promote", "demote"],
      "max_rank": "Member",
      "restrictions": ["cannot_rank_staff", "require_reason"],
      "cooldown": "60s"
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 4: Testing & Verification

### Test Basic Functionality

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test Information Commands">
    ```bash
    /groupinfo
    /memberinfo user:@yourself
    ```
    Verify that group information displays correctly
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Role Sync">
    ```bash
    /sync target:@yourself
    ```
    Check if your Discord roles match your Roblox rank
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Ranking (if applicable)">
    ```bash
    /promote user:@testmember reason:"Setup test"
    ```
    Try a safe ranking operation to verify functionality
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Audit Logs">
    Check that all actions are being logged properly
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Failed" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Symptoms:** "Invalid credentials" or "Authentication error"
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Verify you copied the complete Roblox cookie
    - Ensure you're logged into the correct Roblox account
    - Check that your account has group permissions
    - Try logging out and back into Roblox, then get a fresh cookie
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permission Denied" icon="ban">
    **Symptoms:** "Insufficient permissions" errors
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Verify you own the Roblox group or have admin permissions
    - Check that Synera has the required Discord permissions
    - Ensure your Discord role has permission to use commands
    - Review the permission configuration
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Role Sync Issues" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **Symptoms:** Discord roles don't match Roblox ranks
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Run `/sync target:all` to force synchronization
    - Check role mapping configuration
    - Verify role hierarchy in Discord settings
    - Ensure Synera can manage the roles
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Commands Not Appearing" icon="terminal">
    **Symptoms:** Slash commands don't show up
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Wait a few minutes for Discord to sync commands
    - Check if Synera has "Use Slash Commands" permission
    - Try leaving and rejoining the server
    - Contact support if commands still don't appear after 10 minutes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 5: Advanced Configuration

### Custom Command Channels

Restrict bot usage to specific channels:

```bash
/config channels allowed:#bot-commands,#staff-only
/config channels ranking_only:#ranking-commands
```

### Automatic Synchronization

Configure automatic role synchronization:

```bash
# Enable automatic sync when members join
/config auto_sync join:enabled

# Enable periodic sync (every 6 hours)
/config auto_sync periodic:enabled interval:6h

# Enable sync on role changes
/config auto_sync role_changes:enabled
```

### Logging Configuration

Set up comprehensive logging:

```bash
# Set audit log channel
/config logging channel:#audit-logs

# Configure log levels
/config logging level:detailed

# Enable specific log types
/config logging types:rankings,permissions,errors
```

### Webhook Integration

Connect external services:

```bash
# Add webhook for ranking notifications
/config webhook add url:https://your-webhook-url type:rankings

# Add webhook for member joins
/config webhook add url:https://your-webhook-url type:member_events
```

## Step 6: Member Onboarding

### Automatic Member Processing

When new members join your Discord:

1. **Verification Process**
   - Synera checks if they're in your Roblox group
   - Automatically assigns appropriate Discord roles
   - Sends welcome message with instructions

2. **Manual Verification**
   - Members can link their Roblox account using `/verify`
   - Staff can manually verify members using `/verify user:@member`

### Member Instructions

Create a welcome message for new members:

```markdown
## Welcome to [Your Server Name]! 

To get your roles and access all channels:

1. Make sure you're in our Roblox group: [Group Link]
2. Use `/verify` in #bot-commands to link your account
3. Your Discord roles will automatically match your group rank
