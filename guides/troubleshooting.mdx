## Common Issues

### Authentication Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid Roblox Cookie" icon="cookie">
    **Symptoms:**
    - "Authentication failed" errors
    - Commands fail with "Invalid credentials"
    - Bot cannot access group information
    
    **Causes:**
    - Cookie has expired or been invalidated
    - Incorrect cookie format or incomplete copy
    - Account logged out from another location
    - Roblox security measures triggered
    
    **Solutions:**
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Get Fresh Cookie">
        1. Log out of Roblox completely
        2. Clear browser cookies for Roblox
        3. Log back in to Roblox
        4. Get a new `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify Cookie Format">
        Ensure the cookie starts with:
        ```
        _|WARNING:-DO-NOT-SHARE-THIS.--Sharing-this-will-allow-someone-to-log-in-as-you-and-to-steal-your-ROBUX-and-items.|_
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Update in Synera">
        ```bash
        /setup_community update_auth method:cookie
        ```
        Follow the prompts to securely update your authentication
      </Step>
      <Step title="Test Connection">
        ```bash
        /test connection roblox
        ```
        Verify the new authentication works
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Insufficient Group Permissions" icon="user-slash">
    **Symptoms:**
    - "Access denied" when trying to rank members
    - "Insufficient permissions" errors
    - Can view group info but cannot modify ranks
    
    **Causes:**
    - Account doesn't have admin permissions in the group
    - Group settings restrict API access
    - Account was demoted or permissions changed
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Verify Group Role:**
       - Check your rank in the Roblox group
       - Ensure you have "Manage Members" permissions
       - Confirm you can manually rank members on Roblox
    
    2. **Check Group Settings:**
       - Verify group allows API access
       - Check if group has restricted member management
       - Ensure group isn't in "locked" mode
    
    3. **Test Manually:**
       - Try ranking someone manually on Roblox website
       - If manual ranking fails, the issue is with Roblox permissions
       - Contact group owner to restore permissions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Discord Permission Issues" icon="discord">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Bot cannot assign roles
    - "Missing permissions" errors in Discord
    - Role synchronization fails
    
    **Causes:**
    - Bot missing required Discord permissions
    - Bot role positioned below target roles
    - Server permission overrides blocking bot
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Check Bot Permissions:**
       ```
       Required permissions:
       ✅ Manage Roles
       ✅ Send Messages
       ✅ Use Slash Commands
       ✅ Read Message History
       ✅ Embed Links
       ```
    
    2. **Fix Role Hierarchy:**
       - Move Synera's role above all roles it needs to manage
       - Ensure bot role has higher position than target roles
       - Check for channel-specific permission overrides
    
    3. **Re-invite Bot:**
       If permissions are severely broken, re-invite with correct permissions:
       ```
       https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=BOT_ID&permissions=268435456&scope=bot%20applications.commands
       ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Command Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Slash Commands Not Appearing" icon="terminal">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Commands don't show up when typing `/`
    - "Unknown command" errors
    - Commands worked before but disappeared
    
    **Causes:**
    - Discord hasn't synced commands yet
    - Bot missing "Use Slash Commands" permission
    - Server-specific command registration issues
    - Bot was offline during command registration
    
    **Solutions:**
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Wait for Sync">
        Discord can take up to 1 hour to sync slash commands globally. Wait and try again.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Check Permissions">
        Ensure bot has "Use Slash Commands" permission in server settings.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Force Refresh">
        ```bash
        # Try in DMs with the bot first
        /help
        
        # If that works, the issue is server-specific
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Re-invite Bot">
        If commands still don't appear after 1 hour, re-invite the bot with proper permissions.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Commands Timing Out" icon="clock">
    **Symptoms:**
    - "This interaction failed" messages
    - Commands take too long to respond
    - Partial command execution
    
    **Causes:**
    - Roblox API slowness or downtime
    - Large group operations taking too long
    - Network connectivity issues
    - Bot overloaded with requests
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Check Service Status:**
       - Verify Roblox API status
       - Check Synera status page
       - Test with simple commands first
    
    2. **Reduce Operation Size:**
       ```bash
       # Instead of mass operations, try smaller batches
       /massrank users:@user1,@user2 rank:Member
       # Rather than 20+ users at once
       ```
    
    3. **Retry Later:**
       - Wait a few minutes and try again
       - Use `/status` to check bot health
       - Contact support if issues persist
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Ranking Commands Failing" icon="chart-line">
    **Symptoms:**
    - "Failed to rank member" errors
    - Ranks not updating in Roblox
    - Discord roles not syncing
    
    **Causes:**
    - Target member not in Roblox group
    - Attempting to rank to invalid rank
    - Rate limits exceeded
    - Hierarchy violations
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Verify Target Member:**
       ```bash
       /memberinfo user:@target
       ```
       Check if they're in the group and their current rank
    
    2. **Check Rank Validity:**
       ```bash
       /groupinfo
       ```
       Verify the target rank exists and you can rank to it
    
    3. **Respect Hierarchy:**
       - Cannot rank members higher than your own rank
       - Cannot rank other admins (unless you're owner)
       - Check rank restrictions in your group
    
    4. **Wait for Rate Limits:**
       If you've been ranking many members, wait a few minutes for rate limits to reset
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Synchronization Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Discord Roles Not Syncing" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Member's Discord role doesn't match Roblox rank

    **Causes:**

    **Solutions:**
    1. **Check Role Mapping:**
       ```bash
       /config view role_mapping
       ```
       Verify roles are mapped correctly to ranks
    
    2. **Manual Sync:**
       ```bash
       /sync user:@member
       # or
       /sync all
       ```
    
    3. **Verify Member Account:**
       ```bash
       /memberinfo user:@member
       ```
       Check if their Roblox account is linked and verified
    
    4. **Check Auto-Sync Settings:**
       ```bash
       /config view auto_sync
       ```
       Ensure automatic synchronization is enabled
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Roblox Ranks Not Updating" icon="cube">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Discord shows rank change but Roblox doesn't

    - Inconsistent rank updates
    
    **Causes:**
    - Roblox API delays or issues

    - Roblox maintenance or downtime
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Check Roblox Status:**

    2. **Verify Authentication:**
       ```bash
       /test connection roblox
       ```
    
    3. **Manual Verification:**
       Check the member's rank directly on Roblox website
    
    4. **Retry Operation:**
       ```bash
       /rank user:@member rank:TargetRank reason:"Retry after sync issue"
       ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data Inconsistencies" icon="database">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Bot shows different information than Roblox
    - Cached data appears outdated
    - Member information doesn't match reality
    
    **Causes:**
    - Caching issues
    - Database synchronization problems
    - Recent changes not yet propagated
    - Manual changes made outside of bot
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Force Cache Refresh:**
       ```bash
       /cache refresh scope:member user:@member
       /cache refresh scope:group
       ```
    
    2. **Clear Cached Data:**
       ```bash
       /cache clear type:member_data
       ```
    
    3. **Full Resync:**
       ```bash
